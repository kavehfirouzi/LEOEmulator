 * @brief	Performs pwelch power spectrum estimation and mean frequency calculation
 * @param newData	  : new filtered EMG data
 * @param mean_freq : pointer to the mean frequency
 * @param start   	: marks the start and stop of the calculation of the power spectrum and mean frequency
 * @return	nothing
 * @deteiled         : This function works as a state machine. when it is at reset state and start is 0, it does nothing. when start becomed 1 at reset state, 
 *                     calculation is started and it goes to the running state. In the running state calculation keeps running while start = 1. when start becomes 0,
 *                     calculation is stopped. Power spectrum is finalized, mean frequency is calculated and it goes back to reset state and waites for the next start.
 *                     Pwelch is done by calculatin a 256-fft on overlapping 64-sample wide windows. The amopunt of overlapping is 32 samples. Only 40 frequencies are 
 * 										 calculated according to the fatigue algorithms. execept for the first 32 samples, two overlapping windows are processed at the same time;
 * 										 To take care of the shift between filtered EMG and segmenatation, filtered EMG is stored in fifo first, and after a deley of 432 samples, fed to the fatigue algorithm
 * 										 EMGB_ptrx_1 and EMGB_ptrx_2 are pointers inside the buffer. The former is where we put the new EMG value, the latter is where we read the value to feed the fatigue algorithm
 * 										 They are incremented at every step, when they reach the end of the buffer, they go back to the start. EMGB_ptrx_2 is always one step ahead of EMGB_ptrx_1

/**
 * @brief	Exactly the same as pWelch_rfvm, just using different buffers. Performs pwelch power spectrum estimation and mean frequency calculation
 * @param newData	  : new filtered EMG data
 * @param mean_freq : pointer to the mean frequency
 * @param start   	: marks the start and stop of the calculation of the power spectrum and mean frequency
 * @return	nothing
 * @deteiled         : This function works as a state machine. when it is at reset state and start is 0, it does nothing. when start becomed 1 at reset state, 
 *                     calculation is started and it goes to the running state. In the running state calculation keeps running while start = 1. when start becomes 0,
 *                     calculation is stopped. Power spectrum is finalized, mean frequency is calculated and it goes back to reset state and waites for the next start.
 *                     Pwelch is done by calculatin a 256-fft on overlapping 64-sample wide windows. The amopunt of overlapping is 32 samples. Only 40 frequencies are 
 * 										 calculated according to the fatigue algorithms. execept for the first 32 samples, two overlapping windows are processed at the same time;
 * 										 To take care of the shift between filtered EMG and segmenatation, filtered EMG is stored in fifo first, and after a deley of 432 samples, fed to the fatigue algorithm
 * 										 EMGB_ptrx_1 and EMGB_ptrx_2 are pointers inside the buffer. The former is where we put the new EMG value, the latter is where we read the value to feed the fatigue algorithm
 * 										 They are incremented at every step, when they reach the end of the buffer, they go back to the start. EMGB_ptrx_2 is always one step ahead of EMGB_ptrx_1
